    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**1. Support Vector Machines (SVM):**\n",
    " - **Real world application:** \n",
    "   - By recursively removing irrelevant features, it's quite suited to [Cancer Classification](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1012487302797), by detecting relevant genes to identifying cancer\n",
    " - **Strengths:** \n",
    "   - Has a regularization parameter (\"C\"), which penalizes complexity in a model to avoid overfitting;\n",
    "   - Versatility by [choosing the kernel](http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume11/cawley10a/cawley10a.pdf) to be used to create the separating hyperplane. This allows to fit different patterns of data, covering non-linear data quite well;\n",
    "   - Kernels have additional parameters to control overfitting/underfitting (\"gamma\", \"degree\");\n",
    "   \n",
    " - **Weaknesses:** \n",
    "   - By itself, [behaves poorly with irrelevant features](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/1850-feature-selection-for-svms.pdf);\n",
    "   - Doesn't consider dependencies among features;\n",
    " - **Why this one:** \n",
    "   - Having data that, apparently, is non-linear and contains a lot of entropy, it seems reasonable that the versatility provided by SVMs might come in handy\n",
    "---\n",
    " \n",
    "**2. AdaBoost (Ensemble Method):**\n",
    " - **Real world application:** \n",
    "   - By selecting the strengths of different models, it was the [winner method](http://blog.echen.me/2011/10/24/winning-the-netflix-prize-a-summary/) used by Netflix for prediction of user rates on films, allowing a better recommendation system\n",
    " - **Strengths:** \n",
    "   - Allows use of weak models to provide great results;\n",
    "   - Has higher control over bias and variance errors, depending on which ensemble method is used;\n",
    "   - Versatility to use different probabilistical weak learners, including them merged together;\n",
    "   - Probabilistic powerhouse;\n",
    " - **Weaknesses:** \n",
    "   - Computationally expensive;\n",
    "   - It is harder to implement in a production system as complexity increases;\n",
    " - **Why this one:** \n",
    "   - Honestly, though Ensemble Methods are usually overkill for simple data, they are kind of a trump card for most real world problems. Despite its exhaustively computational use, it's hard to surpass its high score in classification, considering that it already usually deals with overfitting and underfitting if tunned appropriately.\n",
    "---\n",
    " \n",
    "**3. Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB):**\n",
    " - **Real world application:** \n",

    " - **Strengths:** \n",
    "   - Easy on the computer, by simplifying all the math;\n",
    "   - Classifies quite well, being a largely used multiclassification algorithm;\n",
    "   - Highly scalable;\n",
    "   - Penalizes irrelevant features;\n",
    " - **Weaknesses:** \n",
    "   - Overestimates winner classification;\n",
    "   - *\"NB classifiers estimate badly, but often classify well.\"* - From here: [Introduction to Information Retrieval](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/);\n",
    "   - Completely ignores correlation between features, treating them independent (One might love ice cream and broccoli, but maybe not them both together);\n",
    " - **Why this one:** \n",
    "   - Considering the data doesn't seem to hold **too much** correlation between features, it seemed plausible that a Naive Bayes classifier would be appropriate, requiring the lowest computation."

SVC didn't classify anyone as 1 in the 1% dataset, resulting in a warning calculating the F-score. We might forgive that, since it's a 1% sized sample, but it loses by far in processing size, as seen in the first column of graphs. Even if not for that, it loses by a small margin in both accuracy and F-score in the Testing Set to the AdaBoost alternative. So we have a winner here: the AdaBoost Classfier. When dealing with the metrics in the Training Set, it disputes closely to the SVM approach, but even if it lost, we might still choose it, because it clearly wins when predicting on new data (Testing Set), and that's what we want. It won in every sample size of the dataset (1%, 10% and 100%), so there's no question here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AdaBoost Ensemble Method here uses a DecisionTreeClassifier as weak learner and is able to deal with underfitting of the training model (which might explain why it won by a good margin the scores in the 1% sample data). The computation doesn't seem to be a problem here, and we are probably able to tune this method by simplifying Decision Trees with lower depths, minimizing computation, since our Ensemble Method allows high bias weak learners."

    "We have to classify people's salary based on a few characteristics in our dataset. More specifically, if the annual salary is lower or higher than 50,000. Now, suppose you come from the other side of the world and knows nothing of the culture here and how people's income work. If someone were to ask you to guess at someone's annual income, you would probably make a **random guess**. You would pick either one or the other with 50% chance. Now, let's say you gathered 5 people to take their guesses at people's salary. The first one is a young man that has an aunt working at a school. He knows her age, her position and her annual salary. If you asked him to look at our data and guess at some people's annual income and two of them were similar to his aunt, his guess would be a **little bit better than random**. He would probably be right about these two people, thus being trustful about classifying this specific type of people, for in this he has some expertise, hence being our first **weak learner**. Each of our next 4 guessing candidates have some small expertise in some of the characteristics in our dataset and, as a whole, we can combine their individual knowledge to create a full expert at guessing people's annual income. In our case, weak learners will be Decision Trees, which will create rules of thumb for their area of expertise. As an example, our first learner would say *\"Ok, based on what I know, if a person is above 35 years old and is at least a director at a school, he'll make an annual income higher than 50k\"*. This is quite specific, but there's no problem in it, for we will have a lot of Decision Trees, and thus a lot of ground rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "That might sound difficult but, using our AdaBoost model, we have **a lot** of small intuitive weak learners (algorithms) that can tell slightly better than randomly if a person looks like it has one or the other kind of salary. Every time we ask one of the learner their opinion on the classification based on the characteristics provided, we check what it correctly classified and emphasize the ones it missed when asking the next learner its opinion, so it'll make sure to take notice of them. This is important because we already have some other expertises filled, and now we need to focus on what we are still not sure about. Eventually, by having a lot of different conclusions, each progressively taking more notice to what is commonly missed, we get some common rules for classification, and we make them our ground rules for identifying the salary of a person. To make sure our ground rules work, we only ask the opinion for 80% of our data, making it our Training Set. The rest (20%) will be used to make the predictions to check if our ground rules make sense for any data that comes in, and not only for the data trained."

Now, against the **naive model**, it wins by a large margin in Accuracy (0.86 against 0.25) and by a significant one in F-score (0.74 against 0.29).  Since we prioritized Precision, taking a beta value of 0.5, our **naive model** returned a poor F-score, as it puts a higher requirement for our precision, which was the same as our Accuracy (0.25).

    "First of all, in this dataset, usually the continuous features seem to have a linear correlation with the income. That means it might be easier to classify based on them, since we can better define one value for separation, whereas the discrete values may have a more chaotic distribution. I emphasize that it seems to be the case in this dataset, as some continuous features might also be chaotic predictors. Now, ranked from highest to lowest important, in my opinion:\n",
    "1. **capital-gain:** There are a lot of zeroes but, when the capital-gain value is large, the income is usually higher than 50K. It would also make sense, since a capital gain would seem linearly correlated to annual income;\n",

If our assumption is true, we should have a higher probability of higher education leading higher income. If we are wrong, well, we might as well have some statistical evidence of our flawed meritocratic system;\n",

    " - Okay, let me admit that I didn't see the \"age\" feature when answering the previous question, and I would certainly have chosen it as probably third ranked. But let's be honest and don't change anything. It does make a lot of sense, since age is directly correlated to experience and time spent in a carreer;\n",
    " - capital-loss seem to be a huge winner feature, and I didn't consider at all. Since I don't fully understand its nature, I'd have to research further the census. It still probably has the same relationship as mentioned in capital-gain, which is placed in third place here. I believe my assumption was correct and they both are linearly correlated to the income for the reason I mentioned. I'll take that as a personal win;\n",
    " - hours-per-week and education-num were also wins, but being a little less important than I would have thought. education-num actually makes sense being fifth ranked when seeing this graph, since it's probably slightly correlated to age, but a lot less important for classification;\n",
    " - I see that my assumption that continuous features were more important was correct, since every feature identified in this top 5 is continuous.\n",
    " - **EDIT:** This feature selection was made by using the \"gini\" criterion (impurity), default in DecisionTreeClassifier, as opposed to the \"entropy\" (information gain) alternative. Different features might have been found in that case, or even with another algorithm, such as RF, as mentioned by the mentor in the review of the project."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

For most cases, though, if the difference in amount of features returns a significant gain in training time, I would definitely consider use the reduced data as my training set.
