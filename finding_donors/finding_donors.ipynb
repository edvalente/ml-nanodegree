    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "\n",
    "**1. Support Vector Machines (SVM):**\n",
    " - **Real world application:** \n",
    "   - By recursively removing irrelevant features, it's quite suited to [Cancer Classification](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1012487302797), by detecting relevant genes to identifying cancer\n",
    " - **Strengths:** \n",
    "   - Has a regularization parameter (\"C\"), which penalizes complexity in a model to avoid overfitting;\n",
    "   - Versatility by [choosing the kernel](http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume11/cawley10a/cawley10a.pdf) to be used to create the separating hyperplane. This allows to fit different patterns of data, covering non-linear data quite well;\n",
    "   - Kernels have additional parameters to control overfitting/underfitting (\"gamma\", \"degree\");\n",
    "   \n",
    " - **Weaknesses:** \n",
    "   - By itself, [behaves poorly with irrelevant features](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/1850-feature-selection-for-svms.pdf);\n",
    "   - Doesn't consider dependencies among features;\n",
    " - **Why this one:** \n",
    "   - Having data that, apparently, is non-linear and contains a lot of entropy, it seems reasonable that the versatility provided by SVMs might come in handy\n",
    "---\n",
    " \n",
    "**2. AdaBoost (Ensemble Method):**\n",
    " - **Real world application:** \n",
    "   - By selecting the strengths of different models, it was the [winner method](http://blog.echen.me/2011/10/24/winning-the-netflix-prize-a-summary/) used by Netflix for prediction of user rates on films, allowing a better recommendation system\n",
    " - **Strengths:** \n",
    "   - Allows use of weak models to provide great results;\n",
    "   - Has higher control over bias and variance errors, depending on which ensemble method is used;\n",
    "   - Versatility to use different probabilistical weak learners, including them merged together;\n",
    "   - Probabilistical powerhouse;\n",
    " - **Weaknesses:** \n",
    "   - Computationally expensive;\n",
    "   - Complexity increases as it is harder to implement in a production system;\n",
    " - **Why this one:** \n",
    "   - Honestly, though Ensemble Methods are usually overkill for simple data, they are kind of a trump card for most real world problems. Despite its exhaustively computational use, it's hard to surpass its high score in classification, considering that it already usually deals with overfitting and underfitting if tunned appropriately.\n",
    "---\n",
    " \n",
    "**3. Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB):**\n",
    " - **Real world application:** \n",

    " - **Strengths:** \n",
    "   - Easy on the computer, by simplifying all the math;\n",
    "   - Classifies quite well, being a largely used multiclassification algorithm;\n",
    "   - Highly scalable;\n",
    "   - Penalizes irrelevant features;\n",
    " - **Weaknesses:** \n",
    "   - Overestimates winner classification;\n",
    "   - *\"NB classifiers estimate badly, but often classify well.\"* - From here: [Introduction to Information Retrieval](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/);\n",
    "   - Completely ignores correlation between features, treating them independent (One might love ice cream and broccoli, but maybe not them both together);\n",
    " - **Why this one:** \n",
    "   - Considering the data doesn't seem to hold **too much** correlation between features, it seemed plausible that a Naive Bayes classifier would be appropriate, requiring the lowest computation."
